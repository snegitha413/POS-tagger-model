Sequence to Sequence models is a special class of Recurrent Neural Network architectures to solve complex Language problems like Machine Translation, Question
Answering, creating Chatbots, Text Summarization, etc. In this project, Sequence to Sequence Model is used to perform Universal Part Of Speech tagging.
Various Neural Network models are implemented and their performance is evaluated.
